# Overview

With my Note-Taking App, users can create, edit, and organize notes through the terminal interface using the note-taking application. The purpose behind developing this software was to enhance my skills in TypeScript and gain more insights into object-oriented programming concepts.

I intend to extend my knowledge by proving my TypeScript proficiency. I built a note-taking application with TypeScript for this reason. I was able to demonstrate my understanding of different aspects of TypeScript syntax including classes, asynchronous functions, error handling and terminal interaction.

# Development Environment

For the development of this software, I utilized the following tools: Visual Studio Code: A versatile code editor with excellent TypeScript support, Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser, TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language.

I leveraged TypeScript as the primary programming language for this project. Additionally, I made use of Node.js's readline module to interact with the user via the terminal.
